📚 Project Title:
    Crime Pattern Analysis and Prediction System
    
📊 Dataset Idea:
    Crime data from different cities including crime types, locations, and time of occurrence.

🎯 Project Objective:
    Analyze and predict crime patterns to identify high-risk areas and suggest preventive measures.

📝 Problem Statement :
Difficulty in Identifying Crime Hotspots
Traditional crime analysis methods often fail to accurately identify high-risk areas due to a lack of geospatial analysis, making it difficult for law enforcement to allocate resources effectively.

💡 Unique Factors:
✅ Use geospatial data to create a heatmap of crime-prone areas using Folium.
✅ Demonstrate the importance of data cleaning and preprocessing as a crucial step for building robust predictive models.

⚙️ Technologies Used:
Pandas – for data manipulation and cleaning.

NumPy – for handling missing data.

Scikit-learn – for predictive modeling.

Folium – for geospatial visualizations.

Matplotlib – for plotting data trends.

Flask – for building a web-based interface.

SeaBorn - for visual appealing and informative statistical graphics.

Jupyter notebook - for performing these operations
